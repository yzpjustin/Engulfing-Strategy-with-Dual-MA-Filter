Engulfing Strategy with Dual MA Filter
This repository contains an MQL5 file implementing the Engulfing Strategy with Dual Moving Average (MA) Filter. The Engulfing Strategy is a popular candlestick pattern-based trading strategy, and the Dual MA Filter adds additional confirmation using moving averages.

Strategy Overview
The Engulfing Strategy with Dual MA Filter is designed to identify potential trend reversals based on the engulfing candlestick pattern, while taking into consideration the market trend indicated by dual moving averages.

The main components of the strategy are:

Engulfing Candlestick Pattern: The strategy looks for bullish or bearish engulfing patterns, where a larger candle engulfs the previous smaller candle.

Dual Moving Average (MA) Filter: Two moving averages are used to determine the market trend. The strategy considers a bullish engulfing pattern valid only if the current price is above both moving averages, and a bearish engulfing pattern valid only if the current price is below both moving averages.
